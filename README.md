# Final Project: Finch Robot Challenges

## Essential Question
How can we apply object-oriented programming principles and Java concepts to create interactive, autonomous robot behaviors that solve real-world challenges?

## Project Overview
In this project-based learning experience, you will program a Finch 2.0 robot to perform one of three challenges:
1. Choreograph a dance routine (with movement, lights, and sound)
2. Create an artistic drawing using the robot's movements
3. Navigate a maze autonomously

Your program must demonstrate your understanding of Java programming concepts from APCSA and object-oriented design principles while creating an engaging robot behavior.

## Learning Objectives
- Apply Java programming concepts in a physical computing context
- Implement object-oriented design principles
- Develop problem-solving skills through algorithm development
- Create well-documented and maintainable code
- Practice technical communication through presentations and documentation

## Description of design choices
I chose to do a maze solver. I wanted to do this because I felt it was challenging and I find AI and automation intriguing. I've also been coding for years and felt this would be an interesting challenge and learning experience.

## Challenges faced and solutions

Unfortunately, because of the lack of time I was unable to do full automation. I had issues with wall detection and obstacle perception with the robot, and did not get the robot to navigate the maze autonomously. Therefore, I decided to control my robot using input as a way to navigate the maze. 

## Future enhancements

Future enhanchments I would add are ArrayLists that track the movements of the bird. This will help with a system like AI and machine learning, allowing me to train the robot to complete the maze. This would be true automation which I wanted to achieve if I had enough time.
