# Finch Robot: "Robot Talent Show"

## Essential Question
How can we apply object-oriented programming principles and Java concepts to create interactive, autonomous robot behaviors that solve real-world challenges?

## Project Overview
In this project-based learning experience, you will program a Finch 2.0 robot to perform one of three challenges:
1. Choreograph a dance routine (with movement, lights, and sound)
2. Create an artistic drawing using the robot's movements
3. Navigate a maze autonomously

Your program must demonstrate your understanding of Java programming concepts from APCSA and object-oriented design principles while creating an engaging robot behavior.

## Learning Objectives
- Apply Java programming concepts in a physical computing context
- Implement object-oriented design principles
- Develop problem-solving skills through algorithm development
- Create well-documented and maintainable code
- Practice technical communication through presentations and documentation

## Timeline/Checklist

- [ ] Review sample programs from BirdBrain Technologies
- [ ] Create a project plan with pseudocode
- [ ] Set up GitHub repository for your project

### Day 2: Development
- [ ] Write initial code implementation
- [ ] Test basic functionality with the Finch robot
- [ ] Debug and refine your approach
- [ ] Document your progress and challenges

### Day 3: Implementation & Testing
- [ ] Complete core functionality implementation
- [ ] Conduct thorough testing with the robot

- [ ] Prepare for demonstration/presentation
- [ ] Submit final project to GitHub

### Day 5: Presentation & Talent Show
- [ ] Demonstrate your project

## Required Components

### Technical Requirements

- Method overloading or overriding
- Arrays or ArrayLists
- Loops (for, while, etc.)
- Conditional statements
- Exception handling
- File I/O for configuration or logging
- Constants and static methods
- User input processing

### Documentation Requirements
- Well-commented code with appropriate Javadoc
- GitHub repository with organized file structure
- README.md file including:
  * Project description and objectives
  * Installation/setup instructions
  * Usage instructions
  * Description of design choices
  * Challenges faced and solutions
  * Future enhancements
  * Video or images of your robot in action (embedded or linked)

## Project Rubric (16 points total)

| Category | 4 Points | 3 Points | 2 Points | 1 Point |

| **Presentation/Demonstration** | Engaging presentation that clearly explains code design, demonstrates functionality effectively, and addresses technical questions with confidence. | Clear presentation that covers the main aspects of code design and demonstrates functionality adequately. | Basic presentation that shows functionality but lacks depth in explaining design choices. | Insufficient or ineffective presentation of the project. |

## Challenge-Specific Guidelines

### Dance Challenge
Create a choreographed dance routine for your Finch that synchronizes:
- Movement patterns (forward/backward, turns)
- LED light displays (beak and tail)
- Sound patterns using the buzzer
- Consider using arrays to store sequences of movements/lights/sounds

### Drawing Challenge
Program your Finch to create an artistic drawing:
- Design an algorithm to create a recognizable pattern or image
- Use precise motor control for clean lines
- Consider incorporating sensor data to affect the drawing
- Create a system to track position on the drawing surface

### Maze Navigation Challenge
Program your Finch to navigate through a maze:
- Use distance sensors to detect walls
- Implement an algorithm for maze solving (wall following, etc.)
- Consider storing and analyzing the path taken
- Add visual/audio feedback during navigation
- Optional: Allow for maze "learning" and optimization on repeated runs

- [Java API Documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/index.html)

## Extension Opportunities
If you complete your chosen challenge early, consider:
- Adding sensor-responsive behaviors to your program
- Creating a user interface to control robot parameters (JFrame, Swing, JavaFX)
- Implementing multiple modes of operation
- Adding an obstacle detection and avoidance system
